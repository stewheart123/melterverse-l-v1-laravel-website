Welcome to Melterverse!
This is the original MVP I built and applied to Y-Combinator with:
The project allows the user to use a in-browser 3D editor to create a world with more complexity than Minecraft, yet with more ease than Google Sketchup.

Once you have created your world, you are able to save the game data into the same database used in Laravel.
You can then open a completely separate app in your Meta Quest 2 VR headset and see your created world ( with additional multiplayer ability)

The more recent version of Melterverse can be found here: https://melterverse.com/

There are even more features packed into this original version:

Whilst fiddly, it's possible to create your own custom 3D assets and upload them to the platform - thus you can add any 3D object into your VR game!
Select custom assets and add them to your editor / VR experience.

This leads to the possibility of becoming a content creator and having the ability to sell your own assets to other users.

As you can imagine, this project was HUGE - a multiplayer VR app + 3D editor software + full stack website + custom design . As a result of the scope, simply reaching the finishline for this project was a massive achievement. Further refinements / refactoring / performance enhancements etc. are still required - see this as a work in progress / proof of concept / minimum viable product.
